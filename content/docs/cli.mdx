## Overview

The twjlabs/ui CLI is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of integrating the twjlabs/ui component library into your projects. With just a few commands, you can set up your development environment, install necessary dependencies, and scaffold out components with ease.

## Initialization

To get started with the twjlabs/ui CLI, you first need to initialize it in your project. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run the following command:

```bash
npx @twjlabs/ui init
```

This command will set up the basic configuration files and folder structure needed for twjlabs/ui to function properly in your project.

## Adding Components

Once you have initialized the CLI, you can easily add components to your project. To add a specific component, use the following command:

```bash
npx @twjlabs/ui add <component-name>
```

Replace `<component-name>` with the name of the component you wish to add, such as `button`, `modal`, or `navbar`. The CLI will handle the installation and setup for you.
