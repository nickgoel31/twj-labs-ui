Getting started with twjlabs/ui is a breeze. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your first project using our component library.

This Page is solely for cli users. If you're not using the cli, please head to [Manual Setup Guide](/docs/manual-setup)

## Installation

if you're using twjlabs/ui cli, it should be pretty easy for you

<Tabs items={['npm','pnpm']} defaultIndex={1}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
npx @twjlabs/ui init
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm create @twjlabs/ui
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

this installation will set up a new project with twjlabs/ui and all necessary dependencies. It will create a `twj-lib`, `components/ui` and `contexts` folder for you to start building your components right away. It will also make changes to your `css` file accordingly.

That's it! You're now ready to start building with twjlabs/ui. Happy coding!
